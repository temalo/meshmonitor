# Contributing to MeshMonitor

Thank you for your interest in contributing to MeshMonitor! This guide will help you get started with development and ensure your contributions meet our quality standards.

## 🚀 Getting Started



### System Tests (End-to-End)

We have a comprehensive system test suite that verifies the full deployment using Docker.

**Important:** Run these commands from the **project root directory** (the `meshmonitor` directory):

```bash
# Navigate to project root (if not already there)
cd /path/to/meshmonitor

# Run the full system test suite (builds fresh Docker image)
./tests/system-tests.sh

# Run tests against your running dev environment (Fast!)
./tests/dev-test.sh

# Run tests against a specific Meshtastic node
TEST_NODE_IP=192.168.1.50 ./tests/system-tests.sh
```

**What the system tests do:**
- Build a fresh Docker image from your current code
- Run configuration import, quick start, security, reverse proxy, OIDC, virtual node CLI, and backup/restore tests
- Generate a detailed markdown report (`test-results.md`)
- Automatically clean up test containers and volumes

See [tests/README.md](tests/README.md) for detailed documentation and troubleshooting.

### Running Tests Locally


Before submitting a PR, ensure all tests pass:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:run

# Run tests in watch mode during development
npm run test

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test files
npm run test:run src/services/database.test.ts

# Run tests with UI (great for debugging)
npm run test:ui
```

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and components
   - Database operations (`src/services/database.test.ts`)
   - React components (`src/components/*.test.tsx`)
   - API endpoints (`src/server/*.test.ts`)

2. **Type Checking**: Ensure TypeScript types are correct
   ```bash
   npm run typecheck
   ```

3. **Linting**: Follow our code style guidelines
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

### Writing Tests

When adding new features, include appropriate tests:

```typescript
// Example test structure
describe('YourFeature', () => {
  it('should handle normal cases', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });

  it('should handle edge cases', () => {
    // Test edge cases
  });

  it('should handle errors gracefully', () => {
    // Test error handling
  });
});
```

## 🔄 Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Ensure all tests pass:**
   ```bash
   npm run test:run
   npm run typecheck
   npm run lint
   ```

2. **Update documentation** if you've changed APIs or added features

3. **Test your changes** with a real Meshtastic node if possible

4. **Build the project** to ensure it compiles:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run build:server
   ```

### PR Guidelines

1. **Create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/issue-description
   ```
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `test:` Test additions or changes
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

## 🤖 Automated Checks

Our CI/CD pipeline runs automatically on all PRs:

### GitHub Actions Workflows

1. **PR Tests** (`pr-tests.yml`)
   - Runs on every PR
   - Quick validation of changes
   - Type checking and unit tests

2. **Full CI** (`ci.yml`)
   - Comprehensive testing
   - Multiple Node.js versions
   - Docker build validation
   - Security scanning

3. **Release Pipeline** (`release.yml`)
   - Runs on version tags
   - Full test suite
   - Multi-platform Docker builds
   - Automated release notes

### Status Checks

All PRs must pass these checks:
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Linter warnings resolved (or documented)
- ✅ Docker build successful
- ✅ Security scan clean

## 🐛 Reporting Issues

When reporting issues, please include:

1. **Environment details:**
   - Node.js version
   - Operating system
   - Browser (for frontend issues)
   - Meshtastic firmware version

2. **Steps to reproduce**

3. **Expected vs actual behavior**

4. **Error messages and logs**

5. **Screenshots** (if applicable)

## 💡 Feature Requests

We welcome feature requests! Please:

1. Check existing issues first
2. Describe the use case
3. Explain the expected behavior
4. Consider implementation complexity

## 🏗️ Development Tips

### Hot Reloading
Both frontend and backend support hot reloading in development mode.

### Database Development
```bash
# Reset database during development
rm data/meshmonitor.db
# The database will be recreated on next start
```

### Docker Development
```bash
# Build and test Docker image locally
docker build -t meshmonitor:local .
docker run -p 8080:3001 meshmonitor:local
```

### Debugging

1. **Frontend debugging**: Use React Developer Tools
2. **Backend debugging**: Use Node.js inspector
   ```bash
   node --inspect dist/server/server.js
   ```
3. **Test debugging**: Use Vitest UI
   ```bash
   npm run test:ui
   ```

## 📝 Code Style

We use ESLint and TypeScript for code quality:

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Add types for all function parameters and returns
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
