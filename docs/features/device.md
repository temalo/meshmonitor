## LoRa Radio Configuration

### Use Preset

**Description**: Enable or disable using predefined modem configurations.

**Recommendation**: Keep enabled unless you have specific requirements for custom settings.

**Effect**: When enabled, modem parameters (bandwidth, spreading factor, coding rate) are set automatically based on the selected preset.

**Side Effects**: Disabling requires manual configuration of advanced LoRa parameters

::: warning Advanced Configuration
When "Use Preset" is disabled, you must manually configure bandwidth, spreading factor, and coding rate. Incorrect settings can prevent communication with other nodes or violate regulatory requirements. Only disable presets if you have specific technical requirements and understand LoRa modulation parameters.
:::

### Manual LoRa Parameters

These parameters are only available when "Use Preset" is disabled. They provide fine-grained control over radio modulation for advanced users.

#### Bandwidth

**Description**: Channel bandwidth in kHz, which determines the frequency range used for transmission.

**Range**: 31-500 kHz

**Common Values**:
- 31 (31.25 kHz) - Narrowest, best interference resistance
- 125 kHz - Good balance
- 250 kHz - Most common, used by all standard presets
- 500 kHz - Widest, highest data rate

**Effect**: Wider bandwidth = faster data rate but more susceptible to interference. Narrower bandwidth = slower data rate but better sensitivity and interference resistance.

**Side Effects**:
- All nodes must use the same bandwidth to communicate
- Wider bandwidths may violate duty cycle regulations in some regions
- Affects battery life (wider = more power)

**Best Practices**:
- Use 250 kHz for most deployments (matches all standard presets)
- Only change if you have specific range or speed requirements
- Verify regulatory compliance for your region

#### Spreading Factor

**Description**: Number of chirps per symbol, which determines how the signal is spread across time.

**Range**: 7-12

**Effect**: Higher spreading factor = longer range but slower data rate. Each increment doubles range but halves speed.

**Common Configurations**:
- SF7: Shortest range, fastest speed (5.47 kbps @ 125kHz)
- SF9: Medium range (SHORT presets)
- SF10: Good range (MEDIUM presets)
- SF11: Long range (LONG presets)
- SF12: Maximum range, slowest speed (293 bps @ 125kHz)

**Side Effects**:
- Higher SF = longer airtime = more battery usage
- Higher SF = more susceptible to frequency drift
- All nodes must use the same SF to communicate
- Different SFs are orthogonal (can coexist without interference)

**Best Practices**:
- Start with SF11 (LONG_FAST default) for most deployments
- Increase to SF12 only for extreme range requirements
- Lower to SF7-9 for dense local networks

#### Coding Rate

**Description**: Denominator of the forward error correction (FEC) coding rate.

**Range**: 5-8

**Format**: Coding rate is 4/N where N is the value you set (5-8)

**Common Values**:
- 5 (4/5): Lightest error correction, fastest speed
- 6 (4/6): Light error correction
- 7 (4/7): Moderate error correction
- 8 (4/8): Heaviest error correction, most robust

**Effect**: Higher coding rate (larger denominator) = more error correction overhead but better resistance to interference.

**Side Effects**:
- Higher coding rate = longer airtime = more battery usage
- Higher coding rate = slower effective data rate
- All nodes must use the same coding rate to communicate

**Best Practices**:
- Use 8 (4/8) for long-range or noisy environments (LONG_FAST default)
- Use 5 (4/5) for clean, short-range links (SHORT_FAST)
- Most presets use 8 for maximum reliability

#### Frequency Offset

**Description**: Fine-tuning frequency offset in MHz for crystal calibration and drift compensation.

**Range**: Typically ±0.5 MHz

**Default**: 0

**Effect**: Adjusts the transmission frequency by a small amount to compensate for crystal oscillator inaccuracies.

**Use Cases**:
- Compensating for temperature drift
- Correcting known crystal frequency errors
- Fine-tuning for optimal performance with specific hardware

**Side Effects**:
- Incorrect offset can prevent communication
- Should only be changed if you've measured a frequency error
- Most devices do not require adjustment

**Best Practices**:
- Leave at 0 unless you have a specific reason to change it
- Only adjust if you've used test equipment to measure frequency error
- Very rarely needed with modern hardware

### Modem Preset

- **Speed**: Slow
- **Bandwidth**: 250kHz
- **Spreading Factor**: 9
- **Coding Rate**: 4/8
- **Best For**: Dense local networks

#### SHORT_FAST

- **Range**: Short
- **Speed**: Fast
- **Bandwidth**: 250kHz
- **Spreading Factor**: 7
- **Coding Rate**: 4/5
- **Best For**: High-density local networks, fastest messaging

#### SHORT_TURBO

- **Range**: Very Short
- **Speed**: Fastest
- **Bandwidth**: 500kHz (widest)
- **Spreading Factor**: 7
- **Coding Rate**: 4/5
- **Best For**: Close-range, high-speed applications

**Side Effects**:
- All mesh participants must use compatible settings
- Changing presets may disconnect you from the network
- Slower presets = longer airtime = more power usage

**Side Effects**:
- Incorrect region may violate local regulations
- May prevent communication with local mesh networks
- Affects maximum power output and duty cycle limits

::: warning Legal Compliance
Always select the correct region for your location. Using incorrect frequency bands may be illegal and could result in fines or equipment confiscation.
:::

### Hop Limit

**Description**: Maximum number of times a message can be relayed through the mesh.

**Range**: 0-7

**Default**: 3

**Effect**: Limits how far messages can propagate through the network. Each relay counts as one hop.

**Side Effects**:
- **Lower values (0-2)**: Reduced network range, less congestion, lower power usage
- **Higher values (5-7)**: Extended range, increased network load, more battery drain across all nodes
- Value of 7 allows messages to traverse large networks but may cause congestion

**Best Practices**:
- Use default (3) for most deployments
- Increase (4-5) only for very large geographic coverage
- Decrease (1-2) for dense local networks to reduce congestion

### Channel Number

**Description**: LoRa channel number used for frequency hopping within the selected frequency band.

**Range**: 0-255

**Default**: 0

**Effect**: Determines the specific frequency offset within your region's frequency band. All nodes on the same mesh network must use the same channel number to communicate.

**Side Effects**:
- Changing channel number will disconnect you from nodes using different channel numbers
- Can be used to create isolated networks within the same physical area
- Does not affect regulatory region compliance (region setting controls legal frequencies)

**Best Practices**:
- Use default (0) unless you need network isolation
- Change only if you need to avoid interference with another nearby mesh network
- Ensure all nodes in your network use the same channel number

### RX Boosted Gain (SX126x)

**Description**: Enable boosted receive gain mode for devices using SX126x radio chips (e.g., RAK4631, LilyGo T-Beam with SX1262).

**Default**: Disabled

**Effect**: Improves receiver sensitivity, allowing the radio to receive weaker signals and potentially extending range.

**Side Effects**:
- **Increased power consumption**: Boosted gain mode uses more power, reducing battery life
- **May increase noise**: Higher sensitivity can also pick up more background RF noise
- **Only works on SX126x radios**: Has no effect on SX127x or other radio types

**Best Practices**:
- Enable for fixed, powered installations where power consumption isn't a concern
- Consider enabling for routers or infrastructure nodes to improve network coverage
- Disable for battery-powered mobile nodes to maximize battery life
- Test range improvement in your specific environment (results vary)

**Hardware Compatibility**:
- ✅ Works: Devices with SX1262, SX1268 radios (RAK4631, some T-Beam models, Heltec V3)
- ❌ No effect: Devices with SX1276, SX1278 radios (older T-Beam, some Heltec models)

## Position Configuration

### Position Broadcast Interval

**Description**: How often to broadcast GPS position updates.

**Range**: 1-4294967295 seconds

**Default**: 900 seconds (15 minutes)

**Effect**: Controls frequency of position broadcasts to the mesh network.

**Side Effects**:
- Shorter intervals: More network traffic, more current position data, higher power/battery usage
- Longer intervals: Less network traffic, potentially stale position data, lower power usage

**Best Practices**:
- Mobile nodes: 300-900 seconds (5-15 minutes)
- Fixed nodes: 3600+ seconds (1+ hours)
- Disable entirely (very large value) for nodes that don't need position sharing

### Smart Position

**Description**: Intelligently adjusts position broadcast frequency based on movement.

**Effect**: When enabled, broadcasts more frequently when moving, less frequently when stationary.

**Side Effects**:
- Reduces unnecessary broadcasts for stationary nodes
- May delay position updates slightly
- Saves battery on mobile deployments

**Best Practices**: Enable for mobile nodes, optional for fixed installations

### Fixed Position

**Description**: Override GPS with a manually specified location.

**Effect**: Device reports the configured coordinates instead of GPS data.

**Use Cases**:
- Nodes without GPS hardware
- Indoor installations where GPS doesn't work
- Correcting inaccurate GPS readings
- Privacy (hiding exact GPS location)

**Configuration**: When enabled, enter:
- **Latitude**: Decimal degrees (-90 to 90)
- **Longitude**: Decimal degrees (-180 to 180)
- **Altitude**: Meters above sea level

**Side Effects**:
- Position never updates even if device moves
- GPS hardware is not used (saves power)

## Applying Changes

All configuration changes require clicking the "Save" button in each section. Most changes also require a device reboot to take effect. MeshMonitor will notify you when a reboot is required.

## Troubleshooting

### Configuration Not Saving

- Ensure you have a stable connection to the Meshtastic device
- Check that the device is powered and responsive
- Verify you have appropriate permissions

### Device Disconnected After Changes

- Some configuration changes (especially LoRa settings) may temporarily disconnect the device
- Wait 30-60 seconds for the device to reboot and reconnect
- If device doesn't reconnect, verify the configuration is compatible with your mesh network

### Can't Communicate After Region Change

- Ensure region matches other nodes in your mesh
- Verify the frequency is legal in your location
- Check that modem preset is compatible

## Device Configuration Backup

MeshMonitor provides comprehensive backup functionality that exports your complete device configuration in a format fully compatible with the official Meshtastic CLI `--export-config` command.

### What Gets Backed Up

The backup export includes your complete device configuration:

- **Device Settings**: Node identity, role, timezone, broadcast intervals
- **LoRa Radio**: Modem preset, region, bandwidth, spreading factor, coding rate, hop limit, TX power
- **Position**: GPS settings, broadcast intervals, smart position, fixed position coordinates
- **Power**: Battery management, sleep settings, shutdown behavior
- **Network**: WiFi credentials, Bluetooth settings
- **Security**: Device keys (encrypted)
- **MQTT**: Broker settings, encryption, topics, credentials
- **Module Configuration**: All enabled modules (telemetry, neighbor info, canned messages, detection sensor, etc.)
- **Channel Configuration**: All channels with encryption keys (encoded in channel URL)

### Backup Features

#### Automated Backups

MeshMonitor can automatically create backups on a daily schedule:

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Backup**
2. Enable **Automated Backups**
3. Set your preferred backup time (UTC)
4. Configure retention (how many backups to keep)

Automated backups are stored in the `/data/backups/` directory with filenames in the format:
```
{nodeId}-{timestamp}.yaml
```

Example: `43588558-2025-10-28-12-34-18.yaml`

#### Manual Backups

To create an on-demand backup:

1. Navigate to the **Configuration** tab
2. Click the **Backup** button in the top-right corner
3. Choose whether to save to disk or just download
4. The backup file will be downloaded to your computer

### Backup File Format

Backups are saved in YAML format and are fully compatible with the official Meshtastic CLI. The format matches the output of:

```bash
meshtastic --export-config output.yaml
```

This means you can use MeshMonitor backups interchangeably with backups created by the official Meshtastic tools.

Example backup structure:

```yaml
# start of Meshtastic configure yaml
channel_url: https://meshtastic.org/e/#ChASAQE...
config:
  bluetooth:
    enabled: false
    fixedPin: 123456
  device:
    nodeInfoBroadcastSecs: 10800
    role: CLIENT_MUTE
    tzdef: EST5EDT,M3.2.0/2:00:00,M11.1.0/2:00:00
  lora:
    modemPreset: MEDIUM_FAST
    region: US
    hopLimit: 5
  position:
    fixedPosition: true
    positionBroadcastSecs: 1800
location:
  lat: 26.333431
  lon: -80.267695
  alt: 5.0
module_config:
  mqtt:
    enabled: true
    address: mqtt.example.com
owner: My Node Name
owner_short: MNN
```

### Restoring Configuration with Meshtastic CLI

You can restore a MeshMonitor backup to any Meshtastic device using the official Meshtastic CLI tools.

#### Prerequisites

1. Install the Meshtastic Python CLI:
   ```bash
   pip install meshtastic
   ```

2. Connect your device:
   - **USB/Serial**: Connect device via USB cable
   - **Network**: Ensure device is on same network
   - **Bluetooth**: Enable Bluetooth on your computer

#### Restore Process

**Using USB/Serial Connection:**

```bash
meshtastic --configure backup.yaml
```

The CLI will automatically detect your connected device and apply the configuration.

**Using Network Connection:**

```bash
meshtastic --host 192.168.1.100 --configure backup.yaml
```

Replace `192.168.1.100` with your device's IP address.

**Using Bluetooth:**

```bash
meshtastic --ble "Device Name" --configure backup.yaml
```

#### What Happens During Restore

When you restore a configuration:

1. **Device receives configuration**: All settings are sent to the device
2. **Channels are configured**: The channel URL is decoded and all channels are set up with encryption keys
3. **Device reboots**: The device automatically reboots to apply changes
4. **Settings take effect**: After reboot, device operates with restored configuration

::: warning Backup Encryption Keys
The backup includes your device's encryption keys and WiFi passwords. Store backup files securely and never share them publicly. Anyone with access to your backup file can decrypt messages from your mesh network and connect to your WiFi.
:::

### Restore Behavior

#### What Gets Overwritten

When restoring a backup, these settings are **completely replaced**:
- Device identity (names)
- LoRa radio settings
- All module configurations
- Channel settings and encryption keys
- WiFi and Bluetooth settings

#### What Doesn't Change

These items are **not affected** by restore:
- Device hardware model
- Firmware version
- MAC address
- Any locally stored messages or telemetry data

#### Partial Restore

You can manually edit the YAML backup file to restore only specific sections:

1. Open the backup file in a text editor
2. Delete the sections you don't want to restore
3. Save the modified file
4. Run the restore command

For example, to restore only LoRa settings, keep only the `config.lora` section.

### Best Practices

#### Regular Backups

- Enable automated backups to protect against configuration loss
- Create manual backups before making significant configuration changes
- Keep backups after firmware updates in case you need to rollback

#### Backup Storage

- Store backups in multiple locations (local computer, cloud storage, USB drive)
- Keep backups from different time periods (don't immediately delete old backups)
- Consider encrypting backups if storing in cloud services

#### Before Restoring

- Verify the backup file is for the correct device or a compatible model
- Review the backup contents to ensure it has the settings you want
- Make a backup of the current configuration before restoring
- Ensure the device has adequate power (battery or connected to power)

#### After Restoring

- Wait for the device to fully reboot (30-60 seconds)
- Verify critical settings like region and channel configuration
- Test connectivity with other mesh nodes
- Check that module configurations are working as expected

### Troubleshooting

#### Restore Fails or Hangs

- Ensure device is powered and responding
- Check USB cable connection quality
- Try using `--port /dev/ttyUSB0` (Linux/Mac) or `--port COM3` (Windows) to specify port
- Verify Python and meshtastic CLI are up to date:
  ```bash
  pip install --upgrade meshtastic
  ```

#### Device Won't Reconnect After Restore

- Wait 60-90 seconds for full reboot cycle
- If using WiFi, the restored WiFi settings may be different
- Try connecting via USB/serial instead
- Check if region settings are compatible with your local regulations

#### Configuration Partially Applied

- Some settings may require multiple reboots to fully take effect
- Channels in particular may need an extra reboot
- Power cycle the device completely (disconnect power/battery) and reconnect

#### "Invalid Configuration" Error

- Verify the backup YAML file is not corrupted
- Check that the backup is from a compatible firmware version
- Ensure the backup file follows proper YAML formatting
- Try restoring individual sections instead of the complete file

### Use Cases

#### Device Replacement

When replacing a failed device:
1. Restore your backup to the new device
2. The new device will have identical configuration
3. Channels and encryption keys will match your network
4. No manual reconfiguration needed

#### Multiple Identical Nodes

To deploy multiple nodes with the same configuration:
1. Configure one node as a template
2. Export its configuration
3. Edit the backup to change node name/ID for each device
4. Restore to each new device

#### Configuration Templates

Create backup templates for different use cases:
- `router-template.yaml` - Settings for infrastructure nodes
- `mobile-template.yaml` - Settings for handheld devices
- `sensor-template.yaml` - Settings for sensor nodes

#### Testing and Development

- Backup production configuration
- Test experimental settings
- Restore original config if tests fail
- No need to manually track settings changes
