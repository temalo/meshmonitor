# MeshMonitor System Tests

Automated deployment tests for MeshMonitor to verify both Quick Start and Production Reverse Proxy configurations.

## Overview

This directory contains automated tests that verify MeshMonitor works correctly in different deployment scenarios:

- **Quick Start**: Zero-config HTTP deployment (for local/development use)
- **Reverse Proxy**: Production HTTPS deployment behind nginx/Caddy/Traefik
- **Reverse Proxy + OIDC**: Production HTTPS deployment with OpenID Connect authentication

## Quick Start

### Running the Script

Run all system tests from the **project root directory** (recommended before creating/updating PRs):

```bash
# From the project root directory
cd /path/to/meshmonitor
./tests/system-tests.sh
```

**Note:** The script automatically detects the project root using its own location and changes to it (see lines 36-40 in the script). You can run it from any directory, but running from the project root is recommended for clarity.

**What the script does:**
1. Build a fresh Docker image from current code
2. Clean up any existing test volumes
3. Run the Configuration Import test
4. Run the Quick Start deployment test
5. Run the Security test
6. Run the Reverse Proxy deployment test
7. Run the Reverse Proxy + OIDC deployment test
8. Run the Virtual Node CLI test
9. Run the Backup & Restore test
10. Report overall results and generate a markdown report

**Generated Output:**
- Console output with colored test results
- `test-results.md` - Markdown report with detailed test summary

## Individual Test Scripts

### Quick Start Test

Tests the minimal zero-config deployment:

```bash
./tests/test-quick-start.sh
```

**What it tests:**
- Container starts without SESSION_SECRET
- Container starts without COOKIE_SECURE
- HTTP access works (no HSTS headers)
- Admin user created automatically with default credentials
- Login works with default credentials (admin/changeme)
- Session cookies work over HTTP
- Meshtastic node connection (>3 channels, >100 nodes)
- Direct message sending to test node

**Configuration:**
- Node IP: 192.168.5.106
- Port: 8083
- Protocol: HTTP

**Environment Variables:**

You can customize test behavior with these environment variables:

- `TEST_NODE_IP` - IP address of Meshtastic node for testing  
  Default: `192.168.5.106`  
  Example: `TEST_NODE_IP=192.168.1.100 ./tests/test-quick-start.sh`

- `TEST_EXTERNAL_APP_URL` - Test against an already-running deployment instead of creating test containers  
  Default: (none - runs in container mode)  
  Example: `TEST_EXTERNAL_APP_URL=http://localhost:8080 ./tests/test-quick-start.sh`  
  Use case: Test against existing infrastructure or dev environment

- `KEEP_ALIVE` - Keep test containers running after tests complete (for debugging)  
  Default: `false`  
  Example: `KEEP_ALIVE=true ./tests/test-quick-start.sh`  
  Use case: Inspect logs or database state after test completion



### Reverse Proxy Test

Tests production deployment behind HTTPS reverse proxy:

```bash
./tests/test-reverse-proxy.sh
```

**What it tests:**
- Container runs in production mode
- Trust proxy configuration
- HTTPS-ready (COOKIE_SECURE=true)
- Session cookies have Secure flag
- CSRF token works via HTTPS
- Login works via HTTPS
- Authenticated sessions work
- CORS configured for allowed origin
- Meshtastic node connection
- Direct message sending and receiving

**Configuration:**
- Node IP: 192.168.5.106
- Port: 8084 (internal), HTTPS via meshdev.yeraze.online
- Protocol: HTTPS
- Domain: https://meshdev.yeraze.online

### Reverse Proxy + OIDC Test

Tests production deployment with HTTPS reverse proxy and OpenID Connect authentication:

```bash
./tests/test-reverse-proxy-oidc.sh
```

**What it tests:**
- Mock OIDC provider startup and health
- OIDC discovery endpoint (.well-known/openid-configuration)
- MeshMonitor OIDC client initialization
- OIDC authorization URL generation
- OIDC authentication flow (authorization code + PKCE)
- OIDC user auto-creation (when enabled)
- Hybrid auth mode (local + OIDC)
- Session management with OIDC authentication
- Meshtastic node connection
- Direct message sending

**Configuration:**
- Node IP: 192.168.5.106
- Port: 8084 (same as reverse proxy test - tests run sequentially)
- Protocol: HTTPS
- Domain: https://meshdev.yeraze.online
- OIDC Issuer: https://oidc-mock.yeraze.online (mock provider via HTTPS reverse proxy)
- OIDC Client: meshmonitor-test
- Test User: alice@example.com (Alice Test)

**Mock OIDC Provider:**
- Built with node-oidc-provider
- Pre-configured test users
- Automatic authorization grant (for testing)
- Standards-compliant OIDC endpoints
- PKCE required (S256 challenge)

## Test Results

Each test script reports:
- ✓ PASS: Test succeeded
- ✗ FAIL: Test failed (critical - will exit 1)
- ⚠ WARN: Non-critical issue (informational only)
- ⚠ INFO: Informational message

## Development Workflow

### Before Creating a PR

Always run the system tests:

```bash
./tests/system-tests.sh
```

This ensures both deployment configurations work correctly with your changes.

### Before Updating a PR

After making changes based on review feedback, run:

```bash
./tests/system-tests.sh
```

This verifies your updates haven't broken existing functionality.

### Testing Individual Changes

If you're working on a specific deployment scenario:

```bash
# Test only Quick Start changes
./tests/test-quick-start.sh

# Test only Reverse Proxy changes
./tests/test-reverse-proxy.sh

# Test only OIDC integration
./tests/test-reverse-proxy-oidc.sh
```

## Test Details

### Node Connection Verification

Both tests verify Meshtastic node connectivity by checking:
- Channels: Must have >3 channels synced
- Nodes: Must have >100 nodes in database

Tests wait up to 30 seconds for the node to connect and sync data.

### Messaging Tests

Both tests send a direct message to test node:
- Target: Yeraze Station G2 (!a2e4ff4c)
- Quick Start message: "Test in Quick Start"
- Reverse Proxy message: "Test in Reverse Proxy"

Tests wait up to 60 seconds for a response. If no response is received, a warning is shown but the test still passes (node may be offline).

## Cleanup

All tests automatically clean up after themselves:
- Stop and remove test containers
- Remove test volumes
- Remove temporary files and cookies
- Remove docker-compose test files

The `system-tests.sh` script also performs cleanup before running tests to ensure a fresh environment.

## Troubleshooting

### Script Execution Errors

#### "Permission denied" or "command not found"

Make sure the script is executable and you're in the correct directory:

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x tests/system-tests.sh

# Run from project root
cd /path/to/meshmonitor
./tests/system-tests.sh

# Or run with bash explicitly
bash tests/system-tests.sh
```

#### "No such file or directory"

Ensure you're running from the project root:

```bash
# Check current directory
pwd

# Should be in the meshmonitor project root
# If not, navigate to it:
cd /path/to/meshmonitor

# Then run the script
./tests/system-tests.sh
```

#### Script runs but immediately fails

Check that Docker is installed and running:

```bash
# Check Docker status
docker --version
docker ps

# If Docker is not running, start it
sudo systemctl start docker  # Linux
# or use Docker Desktop on macOS/Windows
```

### Tests Failing

1. **Node not connecting**: Verify the Meshtastic node at 192.168.5.106 is accessible
2. **Port conflicts**: Check if ports 8083/8084 are already in use
   ```bash
   # Check if ports are in use (Linux/macOS with lsof)
   lsof -i :8083
   lsof -i :8084
   
   # Alternative for Linux without lsof
   netstat -tulpn | grep :8083
   netstat -tulpn | grep :8084
   
   # Alternative for Windows
   netstat -an | findstr :8083
   netstat -an | findstr :8084
   ```
3. **Docker issues**: Ensure Docker daemon is running and you have permissions
   ```bash
   # Check Docker permissions
   docker ps
   # If permission denied, add your user to docker group
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   # Then log out and back in
   ```
4. **Image build fails**: Check for build errors in the output
   ```bash
   # Try building manually to see detailed errors
   docker build -t meshmonitor:test -f Dockerfile .
   ```

### Running Individual Tests

If system tests fail, run individual tests to isolate the issue:

```bash
# Test Quick Start only
./tests/test-quick-start.sh

# Test Reverse Proxy only
./tests/test-reverse-proxy.sh

# Test OIDC integration only
./tests/test-reverse-proxy-oidc.sh
```

### Manual Cleanup

If tests are interrupted and don't clean up properly:

```bash
# Stop all test containers
docker compose -f docker-compose.quick-start-test.yml down -v
docker compose -f docker-compose.reverse-proxy-test.yml down -v
docker compose -f docker-compose.oidc-test.yml down -v

# Remove test volumes
docker volume rm meshmonitor_meshmonitor-quick-start-test-data
docker volume rm meshmonitor_meshmonitor-reverse-proxy-test-data
docker volume rm meshmonitor_meshmonitor-oidc-test-data

# Remove temporary files
rm -f /tmp/meshmonitor-cookies.txt
rm -f /tmp/meshmonitor-reverse-proxy-cookies.txt
rm -f /tmp/meshmonitor-oidc-cookies.txt
```

## CI/CD Integration

These tests are designed to run locally on the development machine. For CI/CD integration:

- Tests require access to physical Meshtastic node (192.168.5.106)
- Tests require access to production reverse proxy domain
- Consider creating mock versions for CI pipelines

## Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose
- curl
- grep
- Access to Meshtastic node at 192.168.5.106
- Access to meshdev.yeraze.online domain (for reverse proxy test)
