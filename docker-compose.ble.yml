# Docker Compose overlay for BLE-to-TCP Bridge
# Usage: docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.ble.yml up
#
# This adds an optional BLE bridge service that connects to Meshtastic devices
# via Bluetooth Low Energy and exposes a TCP interface on localhost:4403
#
# BLE Bridge Repository: https://github.com/Yeraze/meshtastic-ble-bridge
# See that repository for source code, documentation, and build instructions
